## 3. Preprocessing Summary

* **Encoding:** Categorical values were encoded into numerical form to ensure compatibility with the Logistic Regression model.
* **Scaling:** Numerical features were standardized to place them on a similar scale and improve model convergence.
* **Data Cleaning:**

  * Renamed columns for consistency
  * Checked and handled missing values
  * Removed duplicated records
  * Ensured consistent data types
* **Train–Test Split:** The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate performance on unseen data.
