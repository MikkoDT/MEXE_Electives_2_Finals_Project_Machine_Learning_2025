## :two: 💻 Dataset Overview
- **Dataset Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/daily-food-and-nutrition-dataset
- **Description:** The dataset contains nutritional information of various food items, with each row representing a single food entry. It includes both raw nutrient values (grams, milligrams, calories) and derived macronutrient ratios (percentage of calories coming from protein, carbohydrates, and fat). The goal of the dataset is to analyze nutrient patterns and classify foods into meal types (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack) based on nutritional composition.
- **Target Variable:** `Meal_Type`
  - 🥓`Breakfast`
  - 🍔`Lunch`
  - 🍫`Snacks`
  - 🍲`Dinner`
- **Features Used:** `Macronutrients`
  - **Numerical Features:**
    - `Calories (kcal)`
    - `Carbohydrates (g)`
    - `Protein (g)`
    - `Fat (g)`
    - `Sugars (g)`
    - `Sodium (mg)`
    - `Fiber (g)`
    - `Cholesterol (mg)`
  - **Engineered Features:**
    - `Protein_pct` = *percentage of total calories coming from protein*
    - `Carbs_pct` = *percentage of total calories coming from carbohydrates*
    - `Fat_pct` = *percentage of total calories coming from fat*
