Description: This dataset contains monthly climate and typhoon-related variables in the Philippines from 2014 to 2024. It was used in our machine learning analysis, where Vertical Wind Shear was treated as the dependent variable, and Month, Number of Typhoons, Oceanic Niño Index (ONI), Niño 3.4 Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Anomaly, Western Pacific SST, Midlevel Humidity, Sea Level Pressure, MJO Phase, and Previous Month Typhoon Count were used as independent variables. The dataset supported predictive modeling and pattern learning to understand the behavior of vertical wind shear.
