# Final Assessment — Machine Learning Model

## 1. Pair Information
- Pair Name: **Name**
- Members:
  - **Florendo, Karlo S.**
  - **Pasumbal, Bea Carmela V.**
- Topic: **Machine Failure Prediction using Sensor Data**
- Chosen Model: **Logistic Regression**

## 2. Dataset Overview
- Dataset Source: </br>
  **https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/umerrtx/machine-failure-prediction-using-sensor-data** 
- Description: </br>
  This dataset contains sensor readings collected from various machines and is designed to help predict machine failures in advance. It includes multiple types of sensor measurements along with records indicating whether a failure occurred.
- Target Variable: </br>
  - `fail` - binary indicator of machine failure (1 for failure, 0 for no failure)
- Features Used: </br>
  - `footfall` - number of people or objects passing by the machine
  - `USS` - ultrasonic sensor data, indicating proximity measurements
  - `VOC` - volatile organic compounds level detected near the machine
  - `RP` - rotational position or RPM of the machine parts
  - `Temperature` - the operating temperature of the machine
