## 2. Dataset Overview

Dataset Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams

Description: This dataset is designed to analyze the factors that influence high school students' performance in exams. It typically contains 1,000 observations (students) and explores the correlation between socioeconomic factors and academic outcomes. We used this data set in our machine learning model, where the math scores are treated as the dependent variable.  The primary goal is to understand the influence of a student's background, writing and reading scores, and preparation on their math scores.

Dependent/Target Variable:

- Math Score
