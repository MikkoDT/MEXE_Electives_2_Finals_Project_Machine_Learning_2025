## 📊 2. Dataset Overview

- **Dataset Source:**
  - 🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samira1992/diabetes-intermediate-dataset/data

- **Description:**
    <p align="justify">
<strong>Diabetes Intermediate Dataset</strong> is a well-organized collection of health-related factors that include patient categories, diagnostic measures, and treatment results intended to support research and analysis of diabetes and its progression. The dataset contains a large number of features that can be used to examine the relationships between various medical parameters and the occurrence or management of diabetes in individuals.

- **Target Variable:**
  - 🎯 **Outcome** (*`Non-Diabetic`* / *`Diabetic`*)

- **Features Used:**
  - 👶 *`Pregnancies`*
  - 🍬 *`Glucose`*
  - 💓 *`BloodPressure`*
  - ✋ *`SkinThickness`*
  - 💉 *`Insulin`*

## 🧹 Preprocessing Summary

<div style="text-align: justify">

- **Encoding**  
  ▸ All features in the dataset are numerical; therefore, no categorical encoding was required. The target variable (`Outcome`) is already in binary numerical form and was used directly for model training.

- **Scaling**  
  ▸ Standardization was applied to transform input features to zero mean and unit variance, ensuring equal contribution of variables and improving the stability of the Logistic Regression model.

- **Cleaning Steps**  
  ▸ The dataset was checked for missing values and shuffled to eliminate potential ordering bias.  
  ▸ The target variable was separated from the feature set to prepare the data for supervised learning.

- **Train–Test Split**  
  ▸ The dataset was divided into training and testing sets, with 75% of the data used for training and 25% reserved for testing to evaluate performance on unseen data.
